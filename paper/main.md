# Introduction

The conventional digital representation of a genetic sequence as a string of characters assumes that a species is
sufficiently defined by a single reference genome. As whole genome sequencing has become more accessible, limitations of
this model have become increasingly apparent. The field of _pangenomics_ has emerged in response, bringing software
tools and data models that represent genetic diversity from thousands of individuals at once in the form of a graph
structure [@eizengaPangenomeGraphs2020]. Thus far, these tools have been predominantly applied to fundamental biology,
but a similar problem exists in engineering biology. Developing a microbial strain, plant cultivar, cell line, or
engineered protein also involves hundreds to thousands genetic variants obtained from environmental samples, breeding,
mutagenesis, or genetic engineering. An additional challenge for genetic engineering is the distinction between
_observed_ and _intended_ sequence variants. Digital tools tend to emphasize one type over the other: a synthetic
biology workflow may involve DNA sequencing to confirm that an intended genome edit took place, but discard any
additonal observed mutations. Likewise, a variant calling pipeline may identify all observed mutations, but lose the
engineering context.

Sequence management in engineering biology is further complicated by the iterative nature of the development process.
Organisms or biological parts are commonly subject to multiple, sequential rounds of engineering to arrive at a desired
state. Pangenomes are an underutilized but highly useful tool for modeling iterative engineering. A graph structure can
also represent sequence edits made over time, in addition to the variants that are studied in one experiment. However,
the existing data models are not optimal for representing this type of iterative engineering. Thus, we set out on a data
model which could be a common, growable database of both reference and sample-specific sequences.

While not directly related to pangenomes, we saw another opportunity to couple graph models with another common need in
synthetic biology -- tracking the engineering process itself. The current state of sharing the evolution of a strain to
its final state is ad-hoc. We saw that the addition of variants to a graph can be captured as a set of changes. And if
we can annotate these sets of changes, we are able to devise a version control system for genetic sequences analogous to
_git_ in software engineering. Such a system enables workflows common in software engineering, such as continuous
integration and code review. Additionally, this naturally links the process of genetic engineering with tracking the
work that was done. This provides an easier path for follow-up work such as patent applications and regulatory
compliance.

For these two purposes, Gen was created. Gen offers a growable database of tracking changes to a sequence. Changes are
recorded and can be gathered into a patch, allowing for sharing of work, code review, and testing. Other git-like
functions are also included, such as the ability to create new branches and merge work across branches. Thus, teams can
work in parallel and incorporate changes across branches when necessary. Gen is written in rust and binaries are
available for Linux and OSX platforms.

# Methods

## Graph Representation

Fundamentally, Gen's data model is similar to most graph models where sequences are encoded as vertices with edges
connecting sequences in various orientations. Gen expands on this common model by defining an edge as a connection
between positions and strands within nodes. This enables Gen to model changes in an append-only mode, where changes to
the graph require only addition of data. This is a significant advantage, as the traditional model requires splitting
nodes into sub-nodes when changes are made, introducing overhead for many operations (@fig:graph_model).

![**Overview of Graph data model**\
**a.** Traditional graph where sequences are encoded as nodes and edges connect two nodes together.
**b.** Gen data model where sequences are encoded as nodes and edges connect positions within nodes together. ](graph_model/final.svg){#fig:graph_model}

On importing data, Gen creates a Sequence object, which is a unique database entry. Nodes are then created which
reference a slice of the stored Sequence. This separation has several uses. One is data compression where the same
sequence or subsequence may be referenced by multiple nodes. The other is to resolve cases where an identical sequence
is referenced multiple times within the same graph. For instance, if multiple copies of the same sequence are repeated,
without the node intermediate, Gen would create an unintentional loop by creating an edge between the same sequence.
Instead, Gen creates a node for each repeat, with a unique edge between each. In this way gen can faithfully represent
duplicate segments.

To help illustrate this model, an insertion and deletion are shown in @fig:graph_updates. An insertion or 
replacement of a sequence is represented by creating a new sequence, a corresponding node, and two 
edges. The first edge has its source as the start of the region being replaced (the coordinate of the insertion start)
on the source node, and its target as the start of the created node. The second edge has its source as the end of the 
created node, and its target as the end of the region being replaced. Deletions can be encoded as just one new edge,
from the start coordinate of the region being deleted to the end coordinate of that region.

![**Graph updates**\
**a.** Additions of a sequence and deletion to the graph. Inserts and swaps of sequences are handled by the same logic.
**b.** Database representation of additions and deletions. Models are simplified to illustrate the essential parts. 
The first 2 rows of edges correspond to the addition of the TG sequence and the 3rd edge corresponds to the deletion.
](graph_updates/final.svg){#fig:graph_updates}

For a set of sequences, such as a reference genome of multiple chromosomes, Gen represents a contig using one directed 
graph of nodes and edges. Each set of nodes and edges per contig is termed a Block Group and a join table between 
Block Groups and Edges is used to record all the edges in a block group. Because of the additive nature of insertions, 
replacements, and deletions, block groups can only grow over time. The block group represents all possible sequences 
that can be generated from a chromosome's graph. Edges between block groups can exist, which can serve to model events 
such as translocations.

## Graph Traversal

Several conventions and models are used to facilitate graph traversal. Problems that are common in biological sequence
graphs are: having a defined beginning and end point, predefined paths, and indexing into the graph.

Without a defined beginning and end point, traversing a graph requires enumerating all nodes and edges and identifying
which have no incoming edges (start nodes) and which have no outgoing edges (end nodes). To facilitate this, Gen defines
a virtual start node and a virtual end node to avoid enumerating all nodes to identify starts and ends. On imports and
updates, edges are added to these virtual nodes as needed.

Next, several paths are commonly used in a graph, such as the sequence and coordinates corresponding to the reference
genome. Paths specify an ordered list of edges to traverse, from a start node to an edge node. Paths have a unique name
per collection and sample, meaning the chr1 path can exist only once within a sample.

While paths are able to provide paths from the beginning to the end of a graph, it is just as useful to index within a
graph. Accessions provide a system for relative coordinates within a graph. An accession is a named list of ordered
edges within a graph. Accessions are almost identical to paths but do not have to run from a start node to end node.
Common use of accessions are to identify useful regions in a graph, such as landing pads for genetic modification or
genes of interest.

## Phasing, Ploidyness, and Haplotypes

While we continually add new edges, we need to indicate which edges belong together. Phasing is supported and changes on
the same chromatid will be exported together. Phasing is stored as the chromosome_index field, xx, and yyy.

A similar need for phasing is within combinatorial assembly. This is where a set of parts are engineered in series,
leading to a massive diversity of end products. However, in many cases users want a desired set of paths through these
parts. This is another form of phasing, where a set of parts are linked together much like a haplotype.

To support both of these cases, the concept of a phase layer is utilized. A phase layer groups together variants
representing both haplotypes and linked parts.

## Data Organization

Data is stored in on-disk sqlite database files that act as compartmentalized repositories. Within each database file,
Gen has 3 mechanisms for faceting data -- a graph name, a sample, and a collection. The name of a graph refers to its
underlying biological identity as polynucleotide or polypeptide; the sample identifies a specific variation or instance
of the graph; and a collection groups a set of graphs together. Practically this means that "chromosome I in sample S1"
is a different object than "chromosome I in sample S2", and one graph can be modified without forcing the change to
propagate to the other. But because both graphs share a common universe of node and edge identifiers, variants and
annotations can still be easily compared or propagated between samples if desired.

The interpretation of the sample facet is flexible by design. Depending on the application domain or needs of the user a
sample could refer to a physical specimen or individual, for example, but also an environmental population or pool of
experimental samples. Samples do not have to have a counterpart in the physical world, they can be purely virtual and
refer to a digitally designed sequence or model-derived screening library. Multiple graphs can be associated to the same
sample (e.g. all chromosomes in a genome), but not every graph has to be associated with a sample. If it is not, that
graph is said to be part of the _null_ sample.

## Updating the Graph

Updating a graph has varying levels of difficulty. Linear sequences can be indexed in an intuitive way by coordinates
whereas graphs are indexed by nodes. Sequence graphs are difficult to refer to specific positions within the graph
because positions are dependent upon the edges traversed to each position. Thus, the trivial graph with only a single
path can be treated like a linear sequence, but graphs full of heterozygous changes require far more effort as changes
of unequal length create ambiguity into positions conditionally on which edges were traversed. For this, various
approaches are possible to address the increasing levels of complexity. Where possible, existing standards were used or
expanded upon.

A vcf file of alternative alleles can be used to incorporate changes with multiple samples supported. Accessions may
also be encoded into the VCF file via the INFO tag, where the GAN and GAA tag can be used to provide the accession name
and the allele index for the named accession (@fig:vcf_example a). If an 
accession has been made, it can be used in subsequent changes to refer to a relative region within the graph 
(@fig:vcf_example b).

![**Updating a graph with a VCF**\
**a.** A VCF file with the corresponding graph. An insertion and a deletion are encoded into a VCF file to apply to 
chr1. 
Each change is provided an accession (del1 and ins1, respectively) which enables future updates to refer to the 
these regions. A new sample, foo, is created with these changes.
**b.** Example VCF using the previously defined accession. A new sample, bar, is created from the previously defined 
foo sample. The accession, ins1, is further modified in this new child sample.](vcf_example/final.svg){#fig:vcf_example}

A graph alignment format (GAF) can be used to insert aligned sequences into the graph (@fig:gaf_example). Here, a csv 
file can be used to provide anchoring sequences to identify a position for a change
to be inserted between. The transform command will take this csv, and produce a fasta file that can be aligned via
available graph alignment tools such as minigraph or vg. Then, the resulting GAF and csv file can be provided to the
update command to apply these changes to the graph. Additionally, the GAF file can be manually edited to fine tune the
precise update location as graph aligners may not fully match what users want.

![**Updating a graph with a GAF**\
A csv file can be used to modifed a region of the graph. Anchoring sequences are transformed into a fasta file by 
gen transform, which can then be fed into a graph aligner to identify graph nodes corresponding to the flanking 
sequences. The specified sequence is then added to the graph between the aligned flanks. Deletions can be modeled by 
a blank sequence to insert, and left or right flanks can be omitted to model edits at the extremes of a sequence.](gaf_example/final.svg){#fig:gaf_example}

A graphical fragment assembly (GFA) can be used to augment a graph. Here, we add any new nodes and paths in the supplied
GFA and identify which nodes and paths overlap between the existing database and GFA. Changes to the overlapping nodes
and paths are identified and the database is updated to reflect the additional information.

For simple graphs such as a plasmid or haploid organisms where linear indexing is possible, a fasta file may be provided
to insert its contents ito a given position. This syntax can also be utilized for complex examples if a linear reference
path is established through the graph. For example, a human genome may have many heterozygous changes, but chr1 can
still correspond to the reference genome's path and be used as an index into the graph.

A GenBank file can be provided with changes annotated. Currently, we only support changes encoded in the Geneious
format. Thus, GenBanks can be modified in Geneious and exported to Gen. A similar GenBank export exists where changes
are encoded in a Geneious compatible format so bidirectional information transfer is possible. This allows users to edit
their sequences using a GUI and leverage Gen for tracking of work and graph based analyses.

## Sample Lineage

Gen represents lineage across updates and other operations using samples. A sample is a simple text identifier for a 
set of block groups. The null sample is used to represent non-sample data, such as a reference genome or proteome. 
For example, importing the human reference genome will create a set of block groups under the null sample. If sample 
data from vcfs is then added, new samples will be created and derived from the corresponding contigs belonging to the 
null sample. If nested changed are made, an explicit parent sample can be specified to support iterative engineering.

A common use of samples is for tracking intended engineered and observed variation. This addresses a common problem 
in genetic engineering where only the intended modification is tracked and background variation is not. A sample can 
be created with the intended engineering, and then updated with any additional mutations when needed. In this way, 
gen spans both intended and unintended genetic changes, and can be used to track changes across repeated cycles of 
development and testing.

## Pooling

Add details about how gen represents pooling.

## Operations

There are various methods to change a graph, which we term an operation. Each command that alters the data model such as
update or import is recorded as an operation. Operations are analogous to a commit in git and many git-like
functionalities are present in Gen.

Branches allow work to be carried out in parallel. By default, Gen creates a main branch operations are recorded
against. Operations form a simple tree structure, with each operation having a single parent operation at this time.
Branches may be created off any operation, and nested branches are supported. Branches can be merged into one another
via the merge command. This workflow enables parallel work by teams and easy experimentation. Operations may be reverted
and individual operations can be applied across branches, similar to the git cherry-pick command (@fig:operations_view).

![**Operations**\
**a.** Tree structure formed by a series of operations in different branches.
**b.** Summary of commands related to operations and their similar git equivalents.
](operations_view/final.svg){#fig:operations_view}

A set of operations can be collected into a patch, which is analogous to the git patch which represents a diff of how
the codebase is changed (@fig:dot_example). However, due to the purely additive data model of Gen, diffs are much 
simpler to create as there are no rewrites. Patches are stored as a gzip file and can be shared to distribute changes. 
Viewing of patches is possible via the patch-view command, which will render a dot graph of changes within the patch. 
By commiting these patches and changes into git, this workflow enables many features common to software development 
such as code review and continuous integration testing.

reference sequence whereas a solid line indicates paths adding sequences from other non-reference sources.

segments.](dot_example/final.svg){#fig:dot_example}

## Viewing Operations and Graphs

## Translating coordinate schemes

Annotations can be propagated through the graph structure. Thus, annotations on the reference genome can be translated
into the coordinates of new samples. Coordinates are translated with the following rules:

- If the start and end of the annotation range on the reference map to valid coordinates on the sample sequence, gen
  translates the entire annotation to the later sample.
- If the start and end positions are not present on the child sequence, the annotation is truncated to only include 
  the shared positions.

Annotations may also be translated using node identifiers instead of contig names, which we believe may be useful 
for overlaying annotations in graph vizualization software. Currently, BED and GFF formats are supported for 
propagation and translation.

## Exports

A design goal of Gen was to not replace existing formats, but to complement them. Gen can export its data into a variety
of formats for subsequent use by 3rd party tools. Because graphs can vary significantly in their complexity, several
export options are available to accommodate the varying degrees.

Graphs can be exported into the Graphical Fragment Assembly (GFA) format. Nodes in the Gen graph are translated into GFA
segment ids and paths are exported as well. Gen nodes are converted into segments by concatenating the Gen node id with
the sequence coordinates the node maps to. For example, node 5 which references positions 9-20 of a sequence will be
exported as 5.9.20. The lineage of a sample can also be encoded as a GFA file, where changes from a parent sample to a
descendent will be exported. This is incredibly useful for representing and tracking iterative strain engineering.

Simple graphs can be exported into a GenBank format. Due to the limited information encoded in GenBanks, only simple
graphs such as plasmid or haploid samples will produce a meaningful output. The data export for GenBank currently uses
the Geneious conventions for encoding changes to a sequence, so data can be imported and exported into Geneious for
sequence editing.

Paths within a graph may be exported to a fasta format. This is commonly used to generate a fasta file of a reference
genome or simple graphs where changes are unambiguous (for example, changes to a haploid organism).

## Database

Gen uses a sqlite database. Sqlite was chosen because it is extensively used across all major platforms. It is
additionally a local database, enabling users to use gen without having to set up more complicated databases or require
an internet connection to a cloud service. Sqlite also allows extensibility of the data model via schema migrations and
users can extend the Gen model with new tables to add custom functionality if desired. Updates to gen will be possible
with schema migrations, which help mitigate the version issues plaguing many bioinformatic data formats.

Another consideration for sqlite is it can be accessed via web assembly (WASM), meaning databases stored in places such
an Amazon s3 bucket can be accessed without any dedicated servers. Thus, applications can be developed and ran entirely
on the client side.

## Performance Benchmarks

While extensive benchmarking and performance tuning has not been carried out, owing to the use of Rust, Gen is fairly
performant without much attention to optimizations. Benchmarks were carried out to evaluate the time and storage needs
for importing the reference human genome and updating it with variant data from the 1000 genomes project. (See table
@tbl:test)

Shallow imports of data record only minimal information and do not store the genome sequence. This allows the database
to work strictly off coordinates and fetch the sequence data from disk when needed. Notably, it is extremely useful for
collaborating on large files as it enables a shallow working copy to be used and shared.

For updating with variant data, the size of each vcf file was approximately 17.1 Mb. With addition of many samples
within the same graph can lead to improved data compression as variants shared between samples require less data to be
created.

# Discussion

- The lack of a growable database. Minor changes required regenerating the entire graph and re-exporting it. Graph
  genomes grow at a rate faster than a linear alignment. For example, a single copy of hg38 sufficies for analyses of
  many samples. Whereas with sample specific graphs, each sample requires its own graph as an additional tracked asset.
  This also made it difficult to compare across analyses, as nodes which may be in common between two graph samples
  would have different labels. This could be mitigated by creating a graph encompassing all samples, but this approach
  simply delays the inevitable addition of a new sample, a derivative lineage, or an updated set of variant calls.

## Removed sections

## Inroduction

- observation about in many genetic analyses, the genome doesn't change among samples, the same reference genome is used
  for each. It's good enough for many applications, but syn bio has genomes that change often. The lack of an updateable
  graph format is a major hindrance here, where regenerating a GFA is time consuming and makes it difficult to compare
  across analyses. So we worked on a format where the reference genome could be uodated In many conexs whee he efeence
  genome is used, he pae of updaes is infequen, where the genome is unchanged or slowly changing. This is why there are
  so many examples where hg18 and hg19 are still utilized. Conversely, in scenarios where the genome is changing often,
  such as in synthetic biology where multiple generations of a strain is generated, the reference genome is updating.
  Thus, the previous approaches of a largely static genome are unsuitable. This makes it difficult to compare analyses
  across generations

## Updating Graph section

- Removed `For pooled updates, a custom library format may be provided.`. Should put pooled stuff in its own section.

## Coordinates and indexing

Coordinates in gen are 0-based, and ranges are closed/open. For instance, (0, 5) represents the first five base pairs of
a sequence, and (10, 11) represents the eleventh base pair.
